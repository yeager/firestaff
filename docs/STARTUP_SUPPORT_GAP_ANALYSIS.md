# Five-game startup support gap analysis

Reviewed against `origin/main` at `efb9cc6f9` on 2026-10-25. The repository
contains authentic-media route checks for all five games, but “available,”
“selected,” “handed off,” and “entered a playable runtime” are separate states.
The current evidence does not establish complete five-game startup support.

## Route matrix

| Game | Direct CLI evidence | Main-menu evidence | Current startup result |
|---|---|---|---|
| DM1 | The authentic-media CLI diagnostics exercise direct selection and source-owned startup. | The picker test covers keyboard and mouse handoff; the runtime test checks an authentic first runtime frame. | First runtime is verified on bounded real-media routes. Platform-wide parity and native physical input remain open. |
| CSB | The authentic-media CLI diagnostics exercise direct selection and source-owned startup. | The picker test covers keyboard and mouse handoff; the runtime test checks the authentic starting party and viewport receipt. | First runtime is verified on bounded real-media routes. Platform-wide parity and native physical input remain open. |
| DM2 | The authentic-media CLI diagnostics cover direct selection; platform-specific checks include the complete timed FM Towns title sequence. | The picker test covers keyboard and mouse handoff; the runtime test checks the authentic first party and frame. | First runtime is verified on bounded real-media routes. Other edition and native interaction coverage remains incomplete. |
| Theron | The CLI diagnostics reach its source-owned runtime handoff. | The picker test covers keyboard and mouse handoff; the runtime test checks a loaded authentic Track 02 state. | Runtime state is reached, but the native dungeon renderer still does not produce a state-driven playable view. A documented native-window run showed a black image. |
| Nexus | The CLI diagnostics intentionally expect the title frame and a blocked startup receipt: `levelLoaded=0`, `menu=0`, blocker `menu-bpk-prs3-capture-required`. | Keyboard and mouse selection tests reach the M12-to-M11 handoff, not an active game runtime. There is no Nexus case in the first-runtime probe matrix. | **Not startable as a playable game yet.** The production title/menu consumer and transition to an authenticated level remain gated. The Saturn BKR parser is container-level only and is not wired to save selection or loading. |

## What the existing checks prove

- [`tests/test_m12_main_menu_game_selection_real_media.sh`](../tests/test_m12_main_menu_game_selection_real_media.sh)
  verifies five-card keyboard/mouse selection and authentic-media handoff. Its
  success condition is a `game-handoff` receipt, not a loaded level.
- [`tests/test_m12_main_menu_runtime_real_media.sh`](../tests/test_m12_main_menu_runtime_real_media.sh)
  exercises first-runtime probes for DM1, CSB, DM2, and Theron. The verifier
  requires an active runtime and `levelLoaded=1`; Nexus is not included.
- [`tests/test_firestaff_cli_startup_diagnostics_real_media.sh`](../tests/test_firestaff_cli_startup_diagnostics_real_media.sh)
  checks discovery and direct CLI startup for all five IDs. Its Nexus-specific
  assertion rejects a false `runtime-entered` receipt and requires the blocked
  menu/level gate, so a passing test is not evidence that Nexus is playable.
- These tests use SDL dummy video/audio and authentic installed media. They do
  not establish native window presentation, physical input, audible output,
  complete game playthroughs, or cross-platform gameplay parity.

## Remaining startup work

1. **Nexus:** join authentic Saturn title/menu presentation, input dispatch,
   New Game/Continue selection, and the first `LEV01.DGN` position into one
   source-bound runtime path. Until that evidence exists, retain the startup
   gate and do not count menu-card selection as game startup. See
   [`nexus_startup.md`](nexus_startup.md) and [`TODO-nexus.md`](../TODO-nexus.md).
2. **Theron:** bind the authenticated VDC/VRAM/palette data to a state-driven
   dungeon renderer, then verify the first presented runtime frame and normal
   input against authentic US and Japanese Track 02 data. See
   [`TODO-theron.md`](../TODO-theron.md).
3. **All games:** extend bounded first-runtime receipts across the remaining
   supported editions and native display/input paths. Keep media discovery,
   CLI selection, menu selection, M11 handoff, first runtime, and complete
   gameplay as separately reported milestones.
