# Theron runtime spawn-consumer capture

The Mednafen capture path emits a separate `spawn_consumer_read` receipt. It
is limited to reads of the RAM-loaded helper targets `$5D64/$5D6A` and
instruction fetches inside the byte-verified `$C96B-$CA69` and
`$CC4C-$CD13` US Track 02 consumer bodies.

Those boundaries come from `theron-us-rng-consumers.asm`, including the
authenticated Track 02 BIN offsets and FNV-1a hashes. The receipt preserves
logical and physical addresses, reader PC, reader physical PC, and boundary
flags. It does not infer RNG state, spawn count, monster type, or return-value
ownership. Those remain blocked until one real capture proves the bank
mapping, helper callees, register state, and return contract together.

The output is written beside the live trace as `.spawn-consumer` and is
included in the transition receipt as `spawn_consumer_reads`. A zero count is
valid evidence that the capture did not reach the disassembly-owned consumer;
host-generated data must not replace it.

`theron_v1_mednafen_spawn_consumer_trace_parse_file()` is the admission gate
for this sidecar. It rejects malformed headers, non-contiguous sequences,
non-bank coordinates, mismatched boundary flags and unrelated reads. Even a
ready receipt has `semantic_publication_allowed == 0`.

The companion `.spawn-registers` sidecar is versioned as
`source=mednafen-pce-instrumented-spawn-registers-v3`. It records A/X/Y/SP/P,
MPR0, the selected instruction-page MPR (`mpr_pc`), the disassembly-relevant
`$B3-$BB` RAM bytes, logical PC and physical PC at `$4644`, `$4667`, `$B0E5`,
`$C96B` and `$CC4C` boundary samples. The v3 sidecar additionally marks
`spawn_entry_b0e5=1` exactly at the disassembly's regular-spawn entry `LB0E5`;
the strict runtime parser requires that entry in the same run as the consumer
windows; the execution-only parser may omit it. This is still an entry
observation only and does not publish a spawn. The parser requires
`physical_pc == (mpr_pc << 13) | (pc & $1FFF)` and rejects the old unversioned
sidecar format. This prevents a logical PC copied into `physical_pc` from
being mistaken for authentic HuC6280 bank provenance.

`theron_v1_mednafen_spawn_register_trace_parse_execution_window_file()` is a
deliberately weaker admission path for an execution-only receipt. It requires
both byte-locked consumer windows, contiguous records, valid bank coordinates
and matching boundary flags, but does not require the `$4644` preconsumer or
`$4667` helper. A fresh external-disk state-autoload with the hash-verified US
Track 02 medium produced 2,048 v2 samples: 2,035 in `$C96B-$CA69` and 13 in
`$CC4C-$CD13`, with neither `$4644` nor `$4667` observed. The strict parser
therefore rejects it as a complete spawn capture, while the execution-only
parser records the authentic window entry without publishing RNG, creature,
AI, loot or T700 semantics. Its transition receipt still reports zero
game-owned CD-sector reads, so no later semantic gate is opened by this
capture.

A separate authenticated new-game replay on the same US Track 02 medium
produced 87 v2 register samples, including 16 `$4644` preconsumer entries and
64 `$4667` helper entries. It also observed 161 raw Track 02 sector reads and
2,048 ADPCM FIFO reads, but no `$C96B` samples and no `spawn_consumer_read`
RAM receipts. The two captures must not be merged: doing so would manufacture
a spawn record from separate executions.

The corresponding v3 instrumented replay preserves those observations and
adds the exact `LB0E5` marker. It still observed no `$B0E5` entry in that run;
the strict parser and correlation gate therefore reject it. This is the
intended result: raw sectors and preconsumer/helper windows are not enough to
publish a T900 spawn record.

The corrected startup replay `run@8:60,i@480:30,i@900:30` was then repeated
against the same hash-verified US Track 02 medium. Its input receipt contains
10,145 samples, with Button I on PCE wire bit `0x0001` and Run on `0x0008`;
the capture also reached 161 raw sectors and 215 MPR-bound register samples.
It still produced no `$B0E5` sample, no game-owned dynamic CD read, and no
dynamic return from the `$C96B/$CC4C` consumer windows. The result is a
verified negative handoff, not a spawn record, and cannot be combined with a
different execution to fabricate one.

The follow-up clean replay used
`run@8:60,i@480:30,i@900:30,i@1320:30,i@1800:30`. The five scripted events
were independently verified as Run=`0x0008` and Button I=`0x0001`; the trace
contained 5,943 input samples, 161 raw Track 02 sectors and 87 MPR-bound
spawn-register samples. It still contained no `$B0E5` entry, no game-owned
dynamic CD read and no dynamic consumer return. This is stronger input-path
evidence, but it remains a negative semantic handoff and cannot publish RNG,
spawn, creature, AI, loot, T700 or T900 behavior.

The sidecar remains an execution snapshot only; it does not turn any register
or RAM byte into an RNG value or spawn record.

## 2026-08-09 extended cold-start replay

An additional cold-start replay was run from the hash-verified US Track 02 BIN
and System Card, with input delivered by Mednafen's checked-in PCE replay
producer. It produced 133 register samples in one execution, including
dynamic `$4644` and `$4667` entries while the game was being moved through the
dungeon. The observed `$4667` samples all had `$B3 & $07 != $04`, so the
special RAM-loaded branch at `L4667` was not taken. The run still had no
`$B0E5` entry and no dynamic return-value receipt.

This is useful negative evidence: a helper call is not the same thing as an
RNG result. The parser now records `helper_4667_special_branch_seen`
separately and leaves RNG, regular spawn, creature, AI, loot, T700 and T900
publication closed for this capture.

## 2026-08-09 authenticated `.mc0` replay

The external capture campaign also verified a real Mednafen state, distinct
from the HuBM SRAM files: the state is a 240,789-byte gzip file whose
decompressed payload begins with `MDFNSVST`. It was loaded against
the hash-verified US Track 02 and System Card and replayed with four scripted
PCE transactions. The resulting receipt contains 2,048 source-bound register
samples across `$C96B-$CA69` and `$CC4C-$CD13`; it contains no `$4644`,
`$4667`, or `$B0E5` sample, no game-owned CD-sector read, and no RNG-consumer
sidecar. The execution-only parser accepts the window, but the strict
correlation gate remains closed. These observations are from one authentic
run and are not merged with other captures.

The capture profile binds PCE Button I/1 to `Z` and Button II/2 to `X`.
Comma/period are not assumed as portable macOS bindings; they require an
explicit local Mednafen input-map entry. This control choice is capture
metadata only and does not claim a game-owned Button I/II semantic consumer.
