# Theron runtime spawn-consumer capture

The Mednafen capture path emits a separate `spawn_consumer_read` receipt. It
is limited to reads of the RAM-loaded helper targets `$5D64/$5D6A` and
instruction fetches inside the byte-verified `$C96B-$CA69` and
`$CC4C-$CD13` US Track 02 consumer bodies.

Those boundaries come from `theron-us-rng-consumers.asm`, including the
authenticated Track 02 BIN offsets and FNV-1a hashes. The receipt preserves
logical and physical addresses, reader PC, reader physical PC, and boundary
flags. It does not infer RNG state, spawn count, monster type, or return-value
ownership. Those remain blocked until one real capture proves the bank
mapping, helper callees, register state, and return contract together.

The output is written beside the live trace as `.spawn-consumer` and is
included in the transition receipt as `spawn_consumer_reads`. A zero count is
valid evidence that the capture did not reach the disassembly-owned consumer;
host-generated data must not replace it.

`theron_v1_mednafen_spawn_consumer_trace_parse_file()` is the admission gate
for this sidecar. It rejects malformed headers, non-contiguous sequences,
non-bank coordinates, mismatched boundary flags and unrelated reads. Even a
ready receipt has `semantic_publication_allowed == 0`.

The companion `.spawn-registers` sidecar is versioned as
`source=mednafen-pce-instrumented-spawn-registers-v3`. It records A/X/Y/SP/P,
MPR0, the selected instruction-page MPR (`mpr_pc`), the disassembly-relevant
`$B3-$BB` RAM bytes, logical PC and physical PC at `$4644`, `$4667`, `$B0E5`,
`$C96B` and `$CC4C` boundary samples. The v3 sidecar additionally marks
`spawn_entry_b0e5=1` exactly at the disassembly's regular-spawn entry `LB0E5`;
the strict runtime parser requires that entry in the same run as the consumer
windows; the execution-only parser may omit it. This is still an entry
observation only and does not publish a spawn. The parser requires
`physical_pc == (mpr_pc << 13) | (pc & $1FFF)` and rejects the old unversioned
sidecar format. This prevents a logical PC copied into `physical_pc` from
being mistaken for authentic HuC6280 bank provenance.

`theron_v1_mednafen_spawn_register_trace_parse_execution_window_file()` is a
deliberately weaker admission path for an execution-only receipt. It requires
both byte-locked consumer windows, contiguous records, valid bank coordinates
and matching boundary flags, but does not require the `$4644` preconsumer or
`$4667` helper. A fresh external-disk state-autoload with the hash-verified US
Track 02 medium produced 2,048 v2 samples: 2,035 in `$C96B-$CA69` and 13 in
`$CC4C-$CD13`, with neither `$4644` nor `$4667` observed. The strict parser
therefore rejects it as a complete spawn capture, while the execution-only
parser records the authentic window entry without publishing RNG, creature,
AI, loot or T700 semantics. Its transition receipt still reports zero
game-owned CD-sector reads, so no later semantic gate is opened by this
capture.

A separate authenticated new-game replay on the same US Track 02 medium
produced 87 v2 register samples, including 16 `$4644` preconsumer entries and
64 `$4667` helper entries. It also observed 161 raw Track 02 sector reads and
2,048 ADPCM FIFO reads, but no `$C96B` samples and no `spawn_consumer_read`
RAM receipts. The two captures must not be merged: doing so would manufacture
a spawn record from separate executions.

The corresponding v3 instrumented replay preserves those observations and
adds the exact `LB0E5` marker. It still observed no `$B0E5` entry in that run;
the strict parser and correlation gate therefore reject it. This is the
intended result: raw sectors and preconsumer/helper windows are not enough to
publish a T900 spawn record.

The sidecar remains an execution snapshot only; it does not turn any register
or RAM byte into an RNG value or spawn record.
