# Firestaff TODO — Nexus

Reviewed 2026-09-09. Only open work is listed here; completed evidence belongs
in the Nexus capture and reverse-engineering records.

## Available local retail media

The staged JP retail set supplies the CUE, nine BIN tracks, CDDA WAV tracks,
and the original ZIP package.  The disc itself does **not** contain a Saturn
VDP1/VDP2 VRAM dump, CRAM dump, register snapshot, or frame/timing capture.
Firestaff reads the CUE/ISO members directly in memory; it must not manufacture
either a capture or a presentation claim from those disc files.

The native title renderer consumes the retail `TITLE.BIN`/`TITLE.CG` MAPD
planes, selector sequence and BGR555 palettes directly from the selected CUE/
BIN media. `test_nexus_v1_title_mapd_real`, `test_m11_nexus_startup_gate` and
`test_m11_nexus_startup_runtime_handoff` cover this bounded path. The renderer
does not authorise the separate menu, face, HUD or dungeon compositors.

Four authentic 32 KiB Saturn Backup RAM images with a `DMNEXUS__01` entry
are available in the private real-data corpus. The savegame editor now reads
their block chains and exposes each exact 20,480-byte payload as read-only
hex; it does not assign payload fields or allow rewriting. The
`nexus_v1_saturn_bkr_real_data` CTest validates the real samples when present
and skips when the private sample corpus is absent. Native Saturn save/load
compatibility remains blocked until the payload schema and retail consumer
are source-bound.

An end-to-end check against the installed English Saturn CUE on 2026-09-27
confirms that `--game nexus --platform saturn` opens the original disc and
reaches `phase=nexus-title` with `titleReady=1` after 140 frames. Sending Enter
after 500 title frames still leaves the process at `nexus-title`, with no menu
or level loaded; the startup receipt reports `blocker=faces`. The separate
retail `FACE.BIN` decoder passes for all 20 authenticated portraits, so this
is not missing user media or failed portrait decoding. The remaining join is
PLRD roster row to FACE.BIN ordinal: `nexus_v1_champions.c` deliberately leaves
each `portrait_index` unknown (`-1`) because no Saturn consumer trace proves
the ordinal mapping. CLI launch to the title is therefore verified, but the
interactive Nexus start-menu handoff remains blocked until that real-media
mapping and the corresponding menu consumer are captured.

A same-revision, media-immutable title-session receipt now joins retail CD
FIFO records for LBA 6063--6089 to SH-2 RAM source writes for the same range,
cached SH-2 reads, and frame-stamped VDP2 writes/registers for frames
13294--13455. This closes title CD-to-RAM-to-VDP2 provenance only; it is not
menu, HUD, dungeon, audio or input evidence and does not widen the native
presentation boundary.

- Capture the actual interactive title/menu transition and its input contract,
  including the display consumer that places menu and face material.
  The JP window at frames 13000–13039 is bit-identical with and without
  Start/A pulses, so it is non-interactive animation rather than the native
  startup menu. A later same-session control/Start pair establishes that
  Start is read from the live controller register at frames 18020--18023 by
  SH-2 code, but its 64-frame VDP1/VDP2 output remains byte-identical to the
  no-input control. That reader is therefore not yet an admitted menu
  consumer; find the later transition that changes presentation and bind it
  to the retail menu asset consumer.  A separate post-title control/input
  pair at frames 30000--30119 exercised Start, A, B and C in four distinct
  20-frame pulses.  All eight captured video regions (VDP1 state/VRAM/frame
  buffers/draw selector and VDP2 registers/VRAM/CRAM) were byte-identical to
  the no-input control.  The observed active VDP1 state has two stable
  texture sources for frames 30000--30037, but remains an unbound hardware
  observation rather than proof of a menu, HUD or dungeon consumer.  Search
  beyond this window for the first input-correlated presentation change.
  A further matched JP control/input pair at frames 40000--40079 scheduled the
  remaining Up/Down/Left/Right/X/Y/Z/L/R masks (each for two frames). The
  80-frame raw VDP1/VDP2 capture matched the no-input control byte-for-byte
  (`627a1055274abbd164bc1bab7a9253ae2760e0a1a039ef0c587748ff10083681`),
  and frames 40000 and 40079 rendered identically; the input-event receipt
  confirms only that the external hook scheduled the masks, not that Saturn
  code consumed them. This later window adds no menu/gameplay semantics; the
  first input-correlated presentation change remains open.
  A fresh cold-start matched pair then captured frames 0--279 on the
  authenticated Japanese BIOS/disc: Start was requested at 140--199 and A at
  210--239 in the input run; the control forced no buttons in those windows.
  The SMPC `0x10` read at RPC `0x060103e6` returned `0x10` in the input run
  and `0x00` in control, but all ten sampled rendered frames and the complete
  280-frame raw VDP1/VDP2 stream were identical (both raw SHA-256
  `ea2eb96dc56ce9505d67062b2a5f98141d2a456d413c74c19997c04346e27af3`).
  This confirms delivered input and a live reader, not action semantics or a
  presentation change; startup/menu admission remains blocked.
- Resolve the remaining Structure2/VDP1 material, texture, CLUT, raster,
  clipping, animation and composition ownership with real captures. Keep
  unbound bytes and generated fixtures out of production gameplay. In the
  retained authentic 701-frame JP Saturn window, frame 700 has 249 linked
  VDP1 records; the current compositor resolves 225 of 242 draw commands and
  correctly keeps semantic admission blocked for the 17 unowned draws. The two
  nonzero mode-1 spans at VRAM offsets `0x58b58` (344x177) and `0x58c58`
  (88x177) have no exact or word-byte-swapped match in the 156 files under the
  TRV2 user's `.firestaff/data/nexus` directory. The Japanese retail
  `MENU.BPK` there matches its verified SHA-256
  `740ab2a864f04b89cddb172ce2560044fcc8c6a7f98ae2fe50461aa8da886636`; the
  real-media surface-class test passes and the PRS3 decoder succeeds on all
  162 PRS3 surfaces, but a capture-CLUT/palette-color remap and 4-bpp repacking
  still produce no exact join for either span. Thus neither source ownership
  nor palette, placement, or the original Saturn consumer is established.
  A frame-by-frame pass finds the `0x58c58` source in 287 command lists and
  the `0x58b58` source in 289, spanning relative frames 97--700; each pixel
  span has exactly one SHA-256 across the window, and both commands share one
  stable captured CLUT hash. Their raw signed command coordinates are
  `(-3701,-3701)` and `(-3733,-3733)`; local-coordinate transforms and actual
  visible placement remain unverified. This proves recurring stable runtime
  bytes only, not retail provenance or composition.
  Keep both spans blocked until upload provenance or an exact transformed
  retail-surface join is captured.
- Implement native Saturn runtime semantics only after each dispatcher,
  material, event, save or audio consumer has a captured, hash-verified
  contract.
