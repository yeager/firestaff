# Firestaff DONE — DM1

Reviewed 2026-08-29. Completed work only.

- The real Amiga ZIP → ZIP → ADF and Atari ZIP → ZIP → STX start-menu paths
  now publish their admitted source decoder (`IMG2` and `DMCSB1` respectively)
  only after the original graphics and dungeon pair have both bound.
- The authentic PC DOS 3.4 ZIP start-menu path likewise publishes its admitted
  `IMG3` source decoder only after its original graphics and dungeon pair bind.
- The supplied DOS-EN archive's nested lowercase `dungeon-master/dmaster/DATA`
  layout is now covered independently.  It binds the same authenticated PC
  3.4 graphics/dungeon pair and reaches native CLI, menu, and movement without
  unpacking the original archive.
- The manually unpacked authentic French PC DOS `EUDATA` route now receives the
  same direct start-menu `IMG3` handoff check; its unsupported RAR 2.0 wrapper
  remains a separate diagnostic boundary.
- The authentic German Atari ST 1.2 and French Atari ST 1.3 packages each now
  require their direct start-menu `DMCSB1` handoff before their existing native
  movement assertions run.
- The Amiga 2.0 preservation package now has its own real-media CTest. It
  verifies the exact ZIP → original ZIP → ADF selection, the `IMG2` handoff,
  and a post-menu native movement result rather than relying on the separate
  HD package's coverage.
- The supplied Atari preservation collection now selects only its `[!]`
  original member (`ZIP → ZIP → STX`) and reads its `GRAPHICS.DAT` and the
  release-specific `DUNGEON.DAT` identity entirely in RAM. Direct CLI, the
  startup menu and a native movement probe are covered by real-media CTests;
  cracked sibling images are never admitted.

- PC DOS 3.4 authentic archive startup reaches native DM1 runtime with a
  hash-verified real-media regression.
- M12 resolves the authenticated PC 3.4 data owner and production retains
  fail-closed behavior when required source data is absent.
- DM1 Amiga 2.0 English supplied as ZIP → ZIP → ADF is hash-verified and
  read entirely in RAM. Both direct CLI launch and the startup-menu route
  reach the bounded native runtime without extracting game data to disk.
- The supplied Amiga HD package (preservation ZIP → original HD ZIP → ADF)
  is admitted using the same authenticated Amiga 2.0 graphics/dungeon pair
  and reaches native runtime through direct CLI and the startup menu entirely
  in memory.
- Atari ST original media is source-locked and read in RAM: the supplied
  English 1.0a/1.2, German 1.2 and French 1.3 variants reach native runtime
  through direct CLI and start menu. The German 1.2 protected STX uses the
  verified image identity `0eff1c902ea155f19e4a177bb2ccac7d`, graphics hash
  `2bdc5f431f84c0ece738f54dbd787c3b` and dungeon hash
  `cea11d6e9f7e1698fc95329fe3fb0899`.
- The supplied FM Towns JA/EN archive is verified through both direct CLI
  and start menu, reaching `dm1-runtime` without media extraction.  The
  boot receipt requires the source-bound `TMENU.INF` selection and selected
  `EDM.EXP`/`JDM.EXP` MD5, rather than promoting generic DM1 movement as a
  native FM Towns handoff.
- The supplied authentic French DOS `DMSAVE.DAT` and `DMSAVE.BAK` (48,561
  bytes each; SHA-256 `494d081ee5175b2dccc900d5ea3f25230c8bb3b0f20828d311b8fc5bdfb82d21`
  and `a760234408bf27946b1586ecf396be72e648bd8f3d18abee90a18c2c7e94421f`)
  now pass a native backed-save roundtrip. Each source save is loaded through
  F0435 against its supplied original French `EUDATA`, staged through F0433,
  exported, reloaded through F0435, and checked for party, C03/C04 timeline,
  active-group and dungeon ownership preservation. No save fixture is used.
- The shared required-file catalog retains the verified Amiga 2.0
  `DUNGEON.DAT` identity alongside the Atari additions.  The post-scan
  recovery now republishes a selected ZIP → ZIP → ADF source owner before
  calculating availability, so an Atari preservation scan cannot make a
  valid Amiga launch unavailable.
